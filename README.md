# What?

This repository contains configuration files and settings that I find handy me. Please
note that vim and emacs configs live in separate repos.

*Warning*: current setup is ubuntu specific

## Preparation

You'll need to install powerline first:

```
sudo apt install powerline fonts-powerline
```

Install zsh second: https://ohmyz.sh/

Third - change terminal font djvu sans mono
or status line will miss icons

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/can3p/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
2. `bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh`
3. `source ~/.bashrc`
